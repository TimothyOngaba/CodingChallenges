# CodingChallenges 
This is a repository for my fortnightly coding challenges with the Cancer Genetics Team at UEA
I am not proficient in any of the used languages so I'll often consult Stackoverflow/geekforgeeks and copilot for code efficiency 
The first submission; Christmas tree was to generate a Christmas tree with any decorations using any language of choice. 
The second was on a chatgroup text file to analyse for any parameters of interest, replies, respondents, topics and subtopics, time and date of reply etc
The fourth is about an Esoteric programming language; BrainFuck, the deal was the design of a simple memory friendly compiler 
Fifth is a GUI challenge to move a lion, grass and goad from beach to island without loosing one. I used python with tkinter but this still has errors so not fully functional.
