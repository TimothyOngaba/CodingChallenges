#Christmas bioinformatics song
#To the tune of "Jingle Bells"
#Verse 1
'''
Dashing through the code,
In a bioinformatics way,
Analyzing genes and more,
With algorithms that slay.
Data sets so vast,
Processing them with speed,
Oh, what fun it is to code,
In this scientific creed!
  
#Chorus
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
Oh, what fun it is to code,
In a bioinformatics way, hey!
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
Oh, what fun it is to code,
In a bioinformatics way!
  
#Verse 2
Sequencing the DNA,
Aligning reads with care,
Finding patterns in the strands,
With bioinformatics flair.
Statistical models run,
Predicting functions true,
Oh, what fun it is to work,
In this field so new!
  
#Chorus
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
Oh, what fun it is to code,
In a bioinformatics way, hey!
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
Oh, what fun it is to code,
In a bioinformatics way!
  
#Bridge
From genomes to proteomes,
We analyze it all,
With scripts and tools we hone,
Answering biology's call.

#Chorus
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
Oh, what fun it is to code,
In a bioinformatics way, hey!
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
Oh, what fun it is to code,
In a bioinformatics way!

#Outro
So here's to all the coders,
In bioinformatics cheer,
Merry Christmas and happy coding,
Throughout the coming year!
  
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
Oh, what fun it is to code,
In a bioinformatics way!'''
