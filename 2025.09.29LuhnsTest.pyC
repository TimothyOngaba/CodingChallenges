"""The Luhn test is used by some credit card companies to distinguish valid credit card numbers (16 digits in length) from what could 
be a random selection of digits.Those companies using credit card numbers that can be validated by the Luhn test have numbers that pass the 
following test:

1.      Reverse the order of the digits in the number.
2.      Take the first, third, ... and every other odd digit in the reversed digits and sum them to form the partial sum s1
3.      Taking the second, fourth ... and every other even digit in the reversed digits: Multiply each digit by two and sum the digits 
if the answer is greater than nine to form partial sums for the even digits Sum the partial sums of the even digits to form s2

If s1 + s2 ends in zero then the original number is in the form of a valid credit card number as verified by the Luhn test.

Task: Write a function that will validate a number with the Luhn test"""
